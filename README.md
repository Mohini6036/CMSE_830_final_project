# Lending Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the risk associated with lending loans to customers. The objective is to develop a robust solution that helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions about loan approvals while minimizing default risks. A comprehensive web application built using **Streamlit** serves as the project's final deliverable, allowing stakeholders to interact with data insights and model predictions.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Unveils patterns and trends in the dataset, including correlations between key variables like loan amount, income, and payment history.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales numerical data, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates derived metrics such as debt-to-income ratio and credit utilization.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implements techniques like PCA and SVD for reducing data complexity.
- **Modeling:** Compares and evaluates multiple machine learning models:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Naive Bayes (NB)
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  - Optimally Weighted Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (OWFKNN)
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Utilizes techniques like SMOTE and under-sampling to balance the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes model performance, predictions, and key data insights through an intuitive Streamlit app.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer-level information related to loan applications, such as:
- **Age**
- **Income**
- **Homeownership status**
- **Loan amount requested**
- **Past credit history**
- **Loan payment behavior**

2. Interact with the dashboard to:
   - View data visualizations.
   - Explore feature correlations.
   - Observe model predictions and evaluation metrics.
